\title{Fit convolutional neural networks with neural network library}
\usage{
base_learner_fit_cnn(ymat, xmat, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ymat}{torch::torch_tensor. Dependent variable.}

\item{xmat}{torch::torch_tensor. Independent variables.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to fitting function}
}
\value{
torch-compatible object
}
\description{
This function uses torch as a backend.
Torch currently supports CPU, CUDA, and Metal (Apple Silicon graphics),
thus users can leverage available computational assets
to accelerate the model fitting.
