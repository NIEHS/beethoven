\title{Fit a BART (Bayesian Additive Regression Tree) meta learner. It takes predictions of other models such as kriging, GLM, machine learning models as input and fits a BART Model}
\usage{
meta_learner_fit(base_predictor_list, kfolds, y, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{base_predictor_list}{\itemize{
\item P x 1 list where P = p is a base predictor
vector (numeric). Each predictor vector should be the same length and
named.
}}

\item{kfolds}{integer, index of k-folds for cross-validation. This should be
produced with regards to spatial and/or temporal considerations
To make cross-validation indices, see \link{generate_cv_index}}
